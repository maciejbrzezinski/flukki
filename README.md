## Description
Flukki is an innovative open-source tool designed to revolutionize the way developers approach app development. With a focus on enhancing existing Flutter applications and automating unit test writing, Flukki aims to simplify and speed up the development process.

## Goal
The primary goal of Flukki is to provide developers with a powerful assistant that not only augments existing Flutter apps but also, in the near future, generates new applications from just a description. This project is dedicated to reducing development time and making app creation more accessible.

## Current State
As of now, Flukki is capable of:
- Writing unit tests automatically, saving time and effort in the testing phase.
- Enhancing the logic of existing Flutter applications. [Prompt logic is ready, no UI yet]

## What's Next?
- **App Generation from Descriptions**: The next big step for Flukki is to start working on generating entire applications from scratch based on user descriptions. This feature is set to begin development in the near future.

## How to Run Flukki
To get started with Flukki:
1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have Flutter installed and set up on your machine.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Download the Flukki repository from GitHub.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Run `flutter pub get` in the terminal to install necessary dependencies.
4. **Launch Flukki**: Run the application with `flutter run`.
5. **Setup**: Pass your OpenAI api key, select Flutter project, select Dart SDK path.
6. **Start** using by clicking generate tests buttons in the UI
